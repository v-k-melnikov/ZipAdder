# ZipAdder

  ZipAdder reads the zip file specified as a second parameter using ZipInputStream,
  checks the existing file with name like a name of our file specified as a first parameter.
  Then if this file exists in a archive, ZipAdder replaces content of this file by content
  of our file. If file doesn't exists, ZipAdder creates a directory 'new' and puts file there.
